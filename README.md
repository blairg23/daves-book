# "If There's a God, HELP!" by David A. Allan

A test of faith through difficult times. This is the life story of David A. Allan, a farmer who became an evangelist and faced death multiple times while flying his Cessna over the Arctic Tundra of Canada. Similar to Job, he lost a farm worth millions as well as losing some of those dearest to him and learned to overcome these trials through his faith in God. Through these trials, God led David into a ministry of healing others who have gone through emotional trauma in their lives to give them hope for their future.
